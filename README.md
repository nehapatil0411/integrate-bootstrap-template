📌 Project Description

In this project, I integrated a Bootstrap template into a React application to create a modern, responsive, and professional-looking user interface. Instead of building the design from scratch, I utilized prebuilt Bootstrap components and layouts, then adapted them to React’s component-based architecture.

The template was broken down into reusable React components such as Navbar, Sidebar, Footer, and Content, making the structure easy to manage and scale. Styling and responsiveness were handled with Bootstrap classes, while React took care of rendering dynamic data and interactivity.

By combining React’s component reusability with Bootstrap’s powerful UI design system, the project achieved both fast development speed and aesthetic consistency across all pages.
